A client is created in the login page.

The client has the following "attributes":
    Username (can't be changed)

Once the client logs in, they are redirected to the dashboard page
From here, the client has 3 pages they can visit:
    Dashboard (where they are right now)
    Transactions
    Profile
The client also can logout

Dashboard:
    *see dashboard.webp to have an idea what it will look like*
    This is a page that shows an overview of the account
    Current balance
    Client's credit/debit card (can only have 1 as of now)
    Most recent transactions (money received from other clients and purchases)

Transactions:
    A page dedicated to showing the clients transactions. This page shows ALL of the transactions that occurred since
    the account was created.

Profile:
    Page where the client can see and change some of their information (not all! see above)
