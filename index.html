        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Banco de Melgaço, the only bank where your money is (probably) safe… we think. Nestled in the heart of Melgaço, a town famous for its
          exceptional wine, delicious smoked meats, and questionable banking decisions, we take pride in offering financial services as rich as our local
          flavors—and just as unpredictable!
        </p>

        <h2>A Bank Like No Other</h2>
        <p>
          Founded by a group of visionaries (a.k.a. people who couldn’t get a job anywhere else), Banco de Melgaço was built on the strong belief that anyone
          can run a bank, even us! With decades (okay, months) of experience, we’ve mastered the art of almost balancing our accounts while enjoying a fine
          glass of Alvarinho.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
        <p>🍷 Wine-Inspired Interest Rates – They go up and down depending on how much our accountants have been drinking.</p>
        <p>💰 Secure Deposits (Hopefully) – We store your money in very safe places, like under the manager’s desk or behind the chorizo stockpile.</p>
        <p>📉 Unpredictable Loans – Need a loan? Flip a coin! If it lands on heads, you’re approved. Tails? Well… better luck next time.</p>
        <p>
          📞 Customer Support (Sometimes) – Our team is available from 10 AM to 12 PM (with a break for lunch, of course) and will definitely try to solve your
          problems.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
        <p>
          At Banco de Melgaço, we believe in transparency (especially when it comes to the glass of wine we’re holding). We might not be the most competent
          bankers, but we sure know how to make finance fun! Whether you’re saving for the future or just trying to understand why your account balance keeps
          disappearing, we’re here to help—kind of.
        </p>
